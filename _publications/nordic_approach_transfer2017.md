excerpt: 'In the past few years, a new phenomenon has emerged on the labour market. Spearheaded by a handful of high-profile firms, novel approaches to facilitating transactions between clients and providers have been developed using intermediary digital platforms. This may be seen as an evolution of the so-called sharing economy, a broad term often used to describe ‘systems that activate the untapped value of all kinds of assets through models and marketplaces that enable greater efficiency and access’(Botsman and Rogers, 2011).'
