excerpt: 'Introducing private firms to a labor market previously dominated by a single public employer should improve the wage bargain of workers; by breaking up a public monopsonist, demand-side competition for scarce labor inputs should lift wages closer to competitive rates. Here, I study how the wages and incomes of blue collar care workers and white collar nurses in Sweden are impacted when more employers are introduced as a result of welfare privatization, employing a wage-concentration model and a difference-in-difference event study model of privatization events, using detailed employer-employee matched administrative data. Employer concentration has a relatively strong negative effect on the wages and incomes of nurses, but a much smaller effect on care workers. Privatization events have no significant impact to nurses incomes, while care workers' incomes decrease by 11 to 12 percent. The results suggest heterogeneous effects from privatization based on worker skills; "lower skill" blue collar care workers have been adversely affected by privatization, whereas higher skill white collar nurses have not. The differences are likely rooted in sectoral collective bargaining agreement provisions.'
